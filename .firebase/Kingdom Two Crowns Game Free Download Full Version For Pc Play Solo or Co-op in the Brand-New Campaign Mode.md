You can use these coins to recruit subjects, build structures, upgrade your defenses, and expand your territory. You can also explore the surroundings and find new mounts, artifacts, and secrets.
 
However, you also have to deal with the Greed, a horde of dark creatures that attack your kingdom every night. They will try to steal your coins and your crown, and if they succeed, you will lose the game. You have to balance your spending and saving, and decide when to advance or retreat.
