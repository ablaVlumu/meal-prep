However, Rugal has a more playful and arrogant attitude towards his "godhood". He does not take it as seriously as Igniz, who was obsessed with becoming a true god. Rugal enjoys mocking and taunting his opponents with his supreme confidence and power. He has the most swagger among all the bosses in The King of Fighters. His "godhood" is also reflected in some of his moves, such as his God Press attack, where he slams his enemy to the ground with a divine force.
  
Rugal is a ruthless and charismatic crime lord who has a passion for fighting. He travels around the world in his airship, the Black Noah, and challenges strong fighters to test his skills. He also collects the bodies of his defeated foes and turns them into grisly trophies. He is the mastermind behind the first two King of Fighters tournaments, where he invites fighters from different countries to compete in his twisted game.

Rugal has a cybernetic eye that grants him enhanced vision and the ability to use the Orochi power, a dark and destructive force that he obtained from Goenitz, one of the Hakkesshu. However, Rugal's body cannot handle the Orochi power for long, and it eventually consumes him and causes him to self-destruct.

He then hosts the second King of Fighters tournament, where he faces his ultimate rival, Kyo Kusanagi.
