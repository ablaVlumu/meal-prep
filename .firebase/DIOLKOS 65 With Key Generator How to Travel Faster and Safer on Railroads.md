# Diolkos 65: A Software for Simulating Ancient Ship Transport
 
Diolkos 65 is a software that allows users to simulate the ancient practice of transporting ships across land using the Diolkos, a paved trackway near Corinth in Ancient Greece. The Diolkos was a remarkable engineering feat that enabled boats to avoid the long and dangerous circumnavigation of the Peloponnese peninsula by moving them overland across the Isthmus of Corinth. The Diolkos was in operation from c. 600 BC until the middle of the 1st century AD and played an important role in ancient naval warfare and trade.
