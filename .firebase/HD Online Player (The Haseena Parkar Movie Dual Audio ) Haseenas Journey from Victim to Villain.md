## Haseena Parkar Movie Review
  
While watching Haseena Parkar movie online on ZEE5, you might also be curious about the critical reception of the film. How did the critics and the audience react to this biopic of one of the most notorious women in Indian history?
  
Unfortunately, Haseena Parkar movie did not receive much praise from the reviewers or the viewers. The film was criticized for its poor direction, lack of authenticity, weak script, and biased portrayal of Haseena Parkar as a victim rather than a criminal. The film also failed to explore the complex personality and motivations of Haseena Parkar, who was more than just Dawood's sister.
  
Some of the reviews of Haseena Parkar movie are as follows:

> "Haseena Parkar is yet another film in the long line of hagiographies that Bollywood tends to pass off as gangster films. That a person can be evil and still lead an interesting life worth recounting seems to be beyond the imagination of our film-makers." - Shilpa Jamkhandikar, Reuters[^1^]

> "This crime drama fails to offer an insight into Haseenaâs life whatsoever as an individual, beyond her infamous identity as Dawoodâs sister." - Renuka Vyavahare, Times of India[^2^]

> "The film totally rides on the shoulders of Shraddha Kapoor, who does a damn good job in the titular role of Haseena Parkar. But the film attempts to show her as a victim of circumstances, not as a criminal. Seems she is being harassed just because she is the sister of the 'most wanted' Bhai." - Umesh Punwani, Koimoi[^3^]

> "#HaseenaParkar is a decent film, Shraddha Kapoor performs well, in a de-glamorized role. But the film attempts to show her as a victim of circumstances, not as a criminal. Seems she is being harassed just because she is the sister of the 'most wanted' Bhai." - IMDb user review[^4^]

As you can see, Haseena Parkar movie did not impress many people with its storytelling or its message. However, if you are still interested in watching this film for its historical value or for Shraddha Kapoor's performance, you can do so on ZEE5.
