The film is a typical example of the Category III genre, which features explicit sex and violence. The film is not for the faint-hearted, as it depicts scenes of rape, murder, suicide and torture. The film also explores the themes of immigration, exploitation, culture clash and mental illness. The film is not a realistic portrayal of Hong Kong society, but rather a sensationalized and exaggerated one.
 
The film's main attraction is Isabella Chow, who plays the lead role of Ying. She is a stunning beauty who displays both innocence and sensuality. She also shows courage and resilience in facing the hardships and dangers that come her way. She is supported by Pauline Chan, who plays her friend Au Fung, a fellow mainland girl who works as a prostitute. Jimmy Au plays Kent, the deranged lover who becomes increasingly violent and possessive of Ying. He gives a convincing performance of a man driven by jealousy and madness.
 
The film is not a masterpiece of cinema, but rather a guilty pleasure for those who enjoy erotic thrillers. The film has some flaws, such as poor editing, cheesy dialogue and implausible plot twists. However, the film also has some merits, such as the cinematography, the music and the acting. The film is a cult classic that has gained a loyal fan base over the years.

The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. Some praised the film for its bold and daring portrayal of a woman's struggle and empowerment in a patriarchal society. Some also appreciated the film's aesthetic and erotic qualities, as well as the performance of Isabella Chow. However, some criticized the film for its exploitative and sensationalist nature, as well as its moral ambiguity and lack of realism. Some also found the film's plot to be implausible and inconsistent.
