## Step 3: Adjust Your GPU Settings
 
Now comes the fun part: adjusting your GPU settings to overclock it. Overclocking means increasing the core clock and memory clock of your GPU to make it run faster. However, this also increases the temperature, voltage, and power consumption of your GPU, so you need to be careful and find a balance between performance and stability. Here are some tips for overclocking your GPU with MSI Afterburner:
 
- Start by increasing the core clock slider by small increments of 10-20 MHz and test your GPU stability by running a benchmark or a game. You can use the built-in Kombustor benchmark tool by clicking on the K icon on the top left corner of MSI Afterburner. If your GPU runs stable without crashing or artifacting (visual glitches), you can increase the core clock further until you reach a point where it becomes unstable or too hot.
- Next, increase the memory clock slider by small increments of 10-20 MHz and test your GPU stability again. The memory clock affects the bandwidth of your GPU, which can improve performance in some games. However, increasing the memory clock too much can cause errors or corruption in your VRAM, so be careful.
- If you want to push your GPU even further, you can also increase the voltage and power limit sliders. The voltage slider allows you to increase the voltage supplied to your GPU, which can help stabilize higher clocks. The power limit slider allows you to increase the maximum power consumption of your GPU, which can prevent throttling due to power limits. However, increasing these sliders also increases the heat and stress on your GPU, so you need to monitor your temperature and fan speed closely.
- You can also adjust the fan speed curve by clicking on the fan icon on the bottom center of MSI Afterburner. This allows you to set a custom fan speed profile based on your GPU temperature. You can make your fan run faster or slower depending on how hot your GPU gets. This can help keep your GPU cool and quiet.

## Step 4: Save Your Profile and Apply It
 
Once you find a stable and satisfactory overclock for your GPU, you can save it as a profile by clicking on one of the numbers on the bottom left corner of MSI Afterburner. You can save up to five profiles and switch between them with hotkeys. To apply your profile, click on the checkmark icon on the bottom right corner of MSI Afterburner.
 
## Step 5: Enjoy Your Overclocked Graphics Card
 
Congratulations! You have successfully overclocked your graphics card with MSI Afterburn
