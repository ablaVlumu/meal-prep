## What's New in Skyrim Patch 1.9.32.0.8
 
Skyrim patch 1.9.32.0.8 is the final official update for the game, and it brings some significant changes and improvements. Here are some of the highlights:

- Legendary difficulty setting: This is a new option for players who want a more challenging experience. Enemies are much stronger and deal more damage, while you deal less damage and have lower health and stamina regeneration. You can choose this difficulty at any time from the gameplay menu.
- Legendary skills: This is a new feature that allows you to reset your skills to 15 and refund all your perk points once you reach 100 in that skill. This way, you can level up your skills indefinitely and gain more perk points and levels. You can do this for any skill as many times as you want.
- Bug fixes and performance improvements: The patch fixes hundreds of issues with quests, NPCs, items, animations, graphics, sound, and more. It also improves the stability and performance of the game, especially on PC.
