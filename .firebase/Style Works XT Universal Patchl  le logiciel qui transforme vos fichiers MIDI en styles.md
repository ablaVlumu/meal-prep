Here, you can choose the source format from the left column, and the target format from the right column. For example, if you want to convert a Yamaha style to a Roland style, you would select "Yamaha" from the left column and "Roland" from the right column.

Here, you can browse your computer folders and locate the style file you want to convert. The program supports various formats, such as .sty, .prs, .sst, .pat, .pcg, etc. You can also filter the files by format using the drop-down menu at the bottom.

## Step 3: Edit the Style (Optional)
 
The third step is optional but recommended. It involves editing the style to make it sound better on your keyboard. To do this, you can use the various tools and features of the program, such as:
 
- The "Style Editor", which allows you to modify the parameters of each part of the style, such as instrument, volume, pan, reverb, chorus, etc.
- The "Style Maker", which allows you to create new parts or variations for the style using MIDI files or recorded data from your keyboard.
- The "Style Arranger", which allows you to rearrange the order of the parts or variations of the style.
- The "Style Optimizer", which allows you to optimize the style for your keyboard by adjusting some global parameters, such as tempo, transpose, drum map, etc.

You can access these tools and features by clicking on their respective buttons on the toolbar or by selecting them from the "Tools" menu.
 
You can also preview how the style sounds on your keyboard by clicking on the "Play" button or by pressing F5 on your keyboard. You can change the chord and key using your mouse or keyboard.
