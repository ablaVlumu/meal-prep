L.A. Noire is a detective game set in 1940s Los Angeles, where you play as Cole Phelps, a war veteran and police officer who solves crimes using clues, interrogations and chases. The game was released in 2011 by Rockstar Games and received critical acclaim for its innovative facial animation technology and immersive story.
  
However, some PC players have encountered a problem with the game where it gets stuck on a synchronizing screen after launching it. This issue seems to affect those who have installed the SKiDROW crack for the game, which bypasses the GameShield protection and allows playing without a disc.

## 2. Disable Compatibility Mode
  
Another possible reason for the synchronizing issue is that the game launcher or Steam is running in compatibility mode, which can interfere with the game's performance. To disable it, you need to locate the L.A.Noire.exe file in your game folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\L.A.Noire) and right-click on it. Then, go to Properties > Compatibility and uncheck all the boxes under Compatibility mode and Settings. Do the same for Steam.exe on your desktop or wherever you have it installed. Then, run both files as administrator and try launching the game again.
  
## 3. Verify Integrity of Game Files
  
Sometimes, the synchronizing issue can be caused by corrupted or missing game files, which can be fixed by verifying their integrity through Steam. To do this, you need to open Steam and go to your Library. Then, right-click on L.A. Noire and select Properties > Local Files > Verify Integrity of Game Files. This will scan your game files and download any missing or damaged ones. This process may take some time depending on your internet speed and hard drive space. Once it's done, launch the game again and see if it works.
  
## 4. Apply L.A. Noire v1.2.2610 Update
  
The last possible solution is to apply the latest update for L.A. Noire, which fixes some bugs and improves performance on Windows Vista and Windows 7 systems using DirectX 11 graphics cards. You can download the update from this link: [https://megagames.com/fixes/la-noire-v122610-all](https://megagames.com/fixes/la-noire-v122610-all) [^1^]. After downloading it, unpack it using WinRAR or any other extraction tool and run L.A.Noire.v1.2.2610.Update.exe. Then, install it following the instructions. After that, copy the cracked content from the SKiDROW folder to your main game folder and overwrite any existing files. Then, launch the game again and see if it works.
