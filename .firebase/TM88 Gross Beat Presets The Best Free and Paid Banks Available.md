## What is Gross Beat?
 
Gross Beat is a time and volume manipulation plugin that was developed by Image-Line, the makers of FL Studio. It works by dividing the audio signal into slices and applying different effects to each slice. You can control the effects using a grid that has 36 slots for presets. Each preset has two parts: a time part and a volume part. The time part affects the speed, direction, and pitch of the audio, while the volume part affects the amplitude and panning of the audio.
 
You can use Gross Beat on any audio source, such as drums, melodies, vocals, or samples. You can also automate Gross Beat using MIDI controllers or automation clips in FL Studio. Gross Beat can create a variety of effects, such as:
 
- Glitch: This effect chops up the audio into small pieces and rearranges them in random or rhythmic patterns.
- Stutter: This effect repeats a small portion of the audio at a fast rate.
- Gate: This effect cuts out parts of the audio based on a threshold level.
- Scratch: This effect simulates the sound of scratching a vinyl record.
- Reverse: This effect plays the audio backwards.
- Tape Stop: This effect slows down the audio until it stops.

Gross Beat is a powerful and versatile plugin that can add interest and movement to your beats. However, it can also be overused or misused if you are not careful. Here are some tips to use Gross Beat effectively:

- Use it sparingly: Gross Beat can make your beats sound more dynamic and exciting, but it can also make them sound messy and chaotic if you use it too much. Try to use it only on certain parts of your beat, such as transitions, drops, or hooks.
- Use it creatively: Gross Beat has many presets that you can use to create different effects, but you can also tweak them or make your own to create something unique. Experiment with different settings and combinations to find what works best for your beat.
- Use it musically: Gross Beat can change the rhythm and pitch of your audio, which can affect the harmony and melody of your beat. Make sure that the effects match the key and tempo of your beat and do not clash with other elements.
