## What is Ansys Maxwell 16?
 
Ansys Maxwell 16 is an EM field solver that can solve static, frequency-domain and time-varying magnetic and electric fields. It also offers specialized design interfaces for electric machines and power converters. Ansys Maxwell 16 is part of the Ansys Electronics Desktop suite, which also includes other tools for antenna, RF, microwave, PCB, IC and IC package design.
 
Ansys Maxwell 16 uses a finite element method (FEM) to discretize the geometry and the field equations. It then solves them using a variety of numerical techniques, such as direct solvers, iterative solvers or reduced-order modeling. Ansys Maxwell 16 can handle complex geometries, nonlinear materials, motion effects and multiphysics couplings.
