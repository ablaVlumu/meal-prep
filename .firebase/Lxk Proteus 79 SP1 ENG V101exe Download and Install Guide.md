## What is Proteus 7.9 SP1?
 
Proteus 7.9 SP1 is the latest version of Proteus Design Suite, which includes two main components: ISIS and ARES[^4^].
 
- ISIS stands for Intelligent Schematic Input System. It allows you to create the schematic diagram of your circuit, using a library of almost 800 different microprocessors and other components[^5^]. You can also simulate the behavior of your circuit in real time, using the Virtual System Modelling (VSM) feature[^6^].
- ARES stands for Advanced Routing and Editing Software. It allows you to design the printed circuit board (PCB) layout of your circuit, using automatic or manual routing tools. You can also edit and optimize the placement of your components, and generate the output files for manufacturing your PCB[^4^].
