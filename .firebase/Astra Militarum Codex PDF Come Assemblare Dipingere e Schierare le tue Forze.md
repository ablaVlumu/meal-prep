## Is it Legal to Download the Astra Militarum Codex PDF?
 
The short answer is no. The Astra Militarum codex PDF download is not legal and violates the intellectual property rights of Games Workshop, the company that produces Warhammer 40k. Games Workshop does not offer any official PDF versions of their codices, and any website that claims to do so is likely a scam or a virus.
 
Therefore, we strongly advise you not to download the Astra Militarum codex PDF from any unauthorized source. Not only are you breaking the law and risking your computer's security, but you are also missing out on the benefits of owning a physical copy of the codex.
 
## Why You Should Buy the Astra Militarum Codex
 
There are many reasons why you should buy the Astra Militarum codex instead of downloading it illegally. Here are some of them:
 
- **Quality:** The physical codex is printed in high-quality paper and full-color illustrations. It is also bound in a hardcover that makes it durable and easy to use. The PDF version, on the other hand, may have low-resolution images, typos, or missing pages.
- **Support:** By buying the codex, you are supporting Games Workshop and the Warhammer 40k community. You are helping them create more content and products for your favorite hobby. You are also showing respect for their work and creativity.
- **Updates:** The physical codex is always up to date with the latest rules and errata. Games Workshop regularly releases FAQs and errata documents that clarify or correct any mistakes or ambiguities in the codex. These documents are available for free on their website and can be easily printed or downloaded. The PDF version, however, may be outdated or inaccurate.
- **Experience:** The physical codex is more than just a rulebook. It is also a source of inspiration and immersion for your army. It contains rich lore and background stories that flesh out the history and culture of the Astra Militarum. It also features stunning artwork and photographs that showcase the models and paint schemes of different regiments. The PDF version cannot match this level of detail and atmosphere.

## How to Buy the Astra Militarum Codex
 
If you are convinced that buying the Astra Militarum codex is better than downloading it illegally, you may wonder how to do so. There are several ways to buy the codex:

- **Online:** You can buy the codex online from Games Workshop's official website or from other authorized retailers such as Amazon or eBay. You can also find digital versions of the codex for your smartphone or tablet on Warhammer Digital or Apple Books.
- **In-store:** You can buy the codex in-store from Games Workshop's physical stores or from other hobby shops that sell Warhammer 40k products. You can also find second-hand copies of the codex on local markets or online forums.
