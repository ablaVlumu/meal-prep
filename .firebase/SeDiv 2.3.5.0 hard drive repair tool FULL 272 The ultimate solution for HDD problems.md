# How to Use SeDiv 2.3.5.0 to Repair Hard Drive Firmware Issues
 
If you have a hard drive that is not detected by the BIOS, has a wrong model or capacity, makes clicking noises, or has bad sectors, you may have a firmware problem. Firmware is the software that controls the hard drive's functions and communicates with the computer. Sometimes, firmware can get corrupted due to power surges, physical damage, viruses, or human errors.

In this article, we will show you how to use SeDiv 2.3.5.0 to repair hard drive firmware issues and recover your data.
 
## What You Need
 
- A computer with Windows XP or higher
- A SeDiv 2.3.5.0 software license
- A USB-to-SATA adapter or a SATA-to-IDE adapter (depending on your hard drive interface)
- A working hard drive of the same brand and model as your damaged one (optional but recommended)
- A data recovery software (optional but recommended)

## Step 1: Connect Your Hard Drive
 
The first step is to connect your damaged hard drive to your computer using the USB-to-SATA adapter or the SATA-to-IDE adapter.
 
If your hard drive is not detected by the BIOS or has a wrong model or capacity, you may need to use a special mode called "Direct COM" to communicate with it.
 
To use Direct COM mode:

1. Open your hard drive case carefully and locate the COM port pins on the PCB (printed circuit board).
2. Solder wires to the COM port pins according to this diagram:
